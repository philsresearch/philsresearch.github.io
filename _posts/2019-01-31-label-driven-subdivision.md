### Abstract

In this report I describe some of the ideas and details that went into the
subdivision application I have created for my CPSC 689 course project.
In particular, I provide motivation for an adaptive subdivision scheme,
highlight where the ideas for implementation came from, 
outline the important concepts important to my implementation, show images of what
using the application is like, and conclude with shortcomings
and potential modifications.
The associated codebase can be found
